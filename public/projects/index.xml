      <description>Marie Cordes - A short biography Intro My name is Marie Cordes and I was born on December 6th, 1996 in Bremen, Germany.
I am an open-minded, curious and enthusiastic person. I love to smile and I love to make others smile, too. Always up for a new adventure, I love going new places and trying new things. Athough I can be very stubborn, I am a loving person that puts all of her emotions into the people and things she loves.</description>
