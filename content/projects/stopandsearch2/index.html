<h1>Stop and Search in London</h1>
<p>Stop and search powers help the police to tackle crime. Without the power of being able to stop and search individuals we suspect of having participated in or are about to commit a crime, the Met would be faced with a much tougher challenge on the streets of London. It’s targeted and intelligence-led and practised on people who are suspected of being involved in crime. Find out how it helps to keep our streets safe and what to expect if you are stopped <a href="https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/st-s/stop-and-search/">here</a>.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people">article</a> in The Guardian from January 2019, written by Vikram Dodd, the London Police “disproportionately use[s] stop and search powers on black people.” The following data analysis and visualisations deal with verifying and further investigating these claims as well as exploring what has changed since then.</p>
<p>The analysis entails Stop&amp;Search data from October 2017 to September 2020. As the data for the last months of 2017 and some of the first months in 2018 is not fully representative, we often filter these months, if looked at in detail, out.</p>
<p>After inspecting the initial data available, it is cleaned and processed so that the data set is ready for further exploration and visualisation.</p>

<p>Looking at the density of where which ethnicities are mostly stopped, it is visible that Asian ethnicities are mainly stopped in East and North-East London. Black ethnicities are widely stopped throughout London but compared to White ethnicities that are also stopped throughout the city, Black ethnicities seem to be the only ones frequently stopped in South London.</p>
<p>But does the location of stops and searches already determine a racial bias?</p>
<p>###Stopped and Searched - with racial bias?</p>
<p>Comparing the share of people of different ethnicities that were stopped throughout the last three years, the following picture emerges:</p>

<p>Finally, we can see that until 2019, there was a large divide between Black and White ethnicities that were stopped and searched. Although, in January 2019, Black people made up 15.6% of London’s population and white people made up 59.8%, (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people">source</a>), in 2018, Black people were stopped up to 40% more than White people. Nevertheless, we can also see that after the word got out and the Metropolitan Police Service was accused of racial bias in early 2019, they addressed this issue and the inequality evened out. Today, we can even see that more White than Black people are stopped – in line with more White people than Black living in London.</p>
<p>Today the Metropolitan Police says “Stop and search is never used lightly and police officers will only exercise their legal right to stop members of the public and search them when they genuinely suspect that doing so will further their investigations into criminal activity – whether that means looking for weapons, drugs or stolen property.”(<a href="https://www.met.police.uk/advice/advice-and-information/st-s/stop-and-search/why-we-use-stop-and-search/">source</a>).</p>
<p>This seems to be indeed somewhat truer today – at least in terms of ethnicities. But this may also raise the question: Is there any bias towards what crimes are assumed per ethnicities?</p>
<p>###Stopped and Searched - with further bias?</p>

<p>It is clearly visible that most stops and searches in the city centre are conducted because of stolen goods. The further into the outskirts of London you look, the more offensive weapons and drugs are targeted objects of search. While it seems like theft is a greater issue in Central London, there is no correlation between the searched objects and where the respective ethnicities are mainly targeted.</p>
<p>Seems like the Metropolitan Police Service in London is indeed able to focus on the potential crimes at hand – slowly shedding their reputation for racial bias.</p>
<p><em>Although – despite the population being about 50% male and 50% female, the Metropolitan Police stops about 93% male suspect. Talking about gender bias?</em></p>

<h3>Alberto Cairo’s five qualities of great visualisations</h3>
<p><strong>1. Truthful</strong></p>
<p>All visualisations above are truthful. I did not hide any data or leave any important data points out. Although the data before April 2018 showed an even bigger divide on Black vs. White ethnicities, I left all months before that out because, e.g. March 2018 considered only 19 data points for Black and 11 for White. This may have yielded an even better message but the truth is that this data is not representative as all other months have several thousand data points.</p>
<p><strong>2. Functional</strong></p>
<p>I used several techniques to simplify the data and make it clear as well as interesting without it being too complex. Firstly, I worked with different colours to make all plots better understandable. I used the same colours (e.g. per ethnicity) throughout all plots to make the data points easily understandable. I used maps to visualise the data in a familar format that allows an audience to easily understand the connection of the data to a location on a map. I also used plotly to make visuals simple at first sight but allow the audience to find out more about the details of a plot if they want to.</p>
<p><strong>3. Beautiful</strong></p>
<p>I created all plots with specific focus on the little details to make them beautiful. I used bright colours for the data that is supposed to attract attention and interest and subtle colours for all background information or data that was not relevant to attract immediate attention. I used a clear and simple but beautiful font and made sure that all elements are cohesive in size and format.</p>
<p><strong>4. Insightful</strong></p>
<p>I went beyond the obvious plots to show interesting patters in the data. This is especially true here: In the plot “No racial bias towards Asian ethnicities”, it seems almost as if there is an equal share of White and Black people targeted. Nevertheless, I eliminated all data points with people of Asian ethnicities to investigate this further. This enabled me to find and show the significant difference between share of Black and White people targeted throughout 2018. Further, this plot “Bias towards Black ethnicities was addressed” shows how the divide ever since evened out and today, actually slightly more White people are targeted.</p>
<p><strong>5. Enlightening</strong></p>
<p>I believe that, although the article from The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/26/met-police-disproportionately-use-stop-and-search-powers-on-black-people">“Met police ‘disproportionately’ use stop and search powers on black people”</a> is from 2019, it is still commonly believed that the police stopps more Black than White people - at least so did I. I am certain that a lot of people do not know that this issue has been addressed and is slowly being improved over time. This is an enlightening insight that helps people understand and change their mind about expectations that were formed at the beginning of this analysis when the The Guardian article was introduced.</p>
</div>
<div id="c.r.a.p.-principles" class="section level3">
<h3>C.R.A.P. principles</h3>
<p><strong>1. Contrast</strong></p>
<p>I used several contrasting colours to distinguish and highlight different items. For example, I used green for Asian ethnicities, red for Black and blue for White throughout the analysis. This shows that these are different items (ethnicities) within a plot. The three objects of search in the last plot are also contrastingly coloured to show their difference. Further, in the “No racial bias towards Asian ethnicities” plot, I faded out the Black and White ethnicity bar stacks because the attention is supposed to be driven to the Asian ethnicity bars.</p>
<p><strong>2. Repetition</strong></p>
<p>I used a repetitive plot design and format throughout the entire analysis, enabling visual recognition of these visualisations as part of a whole. I used the same font in all plots, repeating the same boldness and lightness for each plot element. I used the same colour scheme for all elements in each plot, most importantly, always using green for Asian ethnicities, red for Black and blue for White.</p>
<p><strong>3. Alignment</strong></p>
<p>All elements within the plots and all plots among each other (when several plots are in one visualisation) are aligned to show their visual connection.</p>
<p><strong>4. Proximity</strong></p>
<p>I designed all plots in a way that elements that are associated with each other are placed closely together. For example, in the “Bias towards Black ethnicities plot”, each text field is close to the month/time period it describes.</p>
