# Mini biography

## Intro

My name is Marie Cordes and I was born on December 6th, 1996 in Bremen, Germany.

I am an open-minded, curious and enthusiastic person. I love to smile and I
love to make others smile, too. Always up for a new adventure, I love going 
new places and trying new things. Although I can be very stubborn, I am a loving
person that puts _all_ of her emotions into the people and things she loves. 

I am a food lover and world traveler. If I'm home, I love to cook and bake
and if I'm traveling I love (**love!**) trying out new food and eating from 
the local cuisine.

**Three of my favourite things**

1. Practicing yoga
2. Making banana bread 
3. Wearing striped clothes

## Over the years

I was born in Germany and spent all my life there with my family until I was 18.

This is my home town **Bremen**:

After graduating from high school, I was ready to explore the world and wanted 
to see something new. I moved to the UK and lived in **Bedford** as an au-pair 
for a year. One year later, I moved to a small village in Germany called 
**Vallendar** to start my bachelor's degree at WHU - Otto Beisheim School of 
Management. I had an incredible 3 years at WHU, meeting great people, making 
good friends, learning a whole lot more about the world (_learning a whole lot 
more about myself, too_) and exploring the world.

As part of my studies, I spent my first summer internship in **Hong Kong**, 
working at a music-tech start-up. I loved living in Hong Kong, getting to 
know the city, its people and its culture.

My favourite dishes that I got to know there are:

- BBQ Pork Buns
- Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings)
- Vietnamese Rice Vermicelli

After spending some time back at uni and doing another internship in 
**Frankfurt**, I spent a semester abroad at Tulane University in **New Orleans** 
in the US. I had a great time there, exploring the American South and its unique culture. If you have not been there - go see yourself. There is no place like NOLA!

_Don't forget to try the **beignets**!_

After returning to Germany and graduating from university, I spent the last year
as a _gap year_. I did several internships in **Berlin** and **Hamburg** and 
traveled through Portugal and Italy (_since I wasn't able go to Asia as originally
planned... - hopefully another time!_)

## Next steps

Now I am ready for a new adventure! I am currently reading for the Masters in Analytics and Management at London Business School in **London**. 

Let's see where my next chapter is going to take me! :-)
