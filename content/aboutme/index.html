<h1>Mini biography</h1>
<div id="intro" class="section level2">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>My name is Marie Cordes and I was born on December 6th, 1996 in Bremen, Germany.</p>
<p>I am an open-minded, curious and enthusiastic person. I love to smile and I
love to make others smile, too. Always up for a new adventure, I love going
new places and trying new things. Although I can be very stubborn, I am a loving
person that puts <em>all</em> of her emotions into the people and things she loves.</p>
<p>I am a food lover and world traveler. If I’m home, I love to cook and bake
and if I’m traveling I love (<strong>love!</strong>) trying out new food and eating from
the local cuisine.</p>
<p><strong>Three of my favourite things</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Practicing yoga</li>
<li>Making banana bread</li>
<li>Wearing striped clothes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Over the years</h2>
<p>I was born in Germany and spent all my life there with my family until I was 18.</p>
<p>This is my home town <strong>Bremen</strong>:</p>

<p>After graduating from high school, I was ready to explore the world and wanted
to see something new. I moved to the UK and lived in <strong>Bedford</strong> as an au-pair
for a year. One year later, I moved to a small village in Germany called
<strong>Vallendar</strong> to start my bachelor’s degree at WHU - Otto Beisheim School of
Management. I had an incredible 3 years at WHU, meeting great people, making
good friends, learning a whole lot more about the world (<em>learning a whole lot
more about myself, too</em>) and exploring the world.</p>
<p>As part of my studies, I spent my first summer internship in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>,
working at a music-tech start-up. I loved living in Hong Kong, getting to
know the city, its people and its culture.</p>
<p>My favourite dishes that I got to know there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>BBQ Pork Buns</li>
<li>Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings)</li>
<li>Vietnamese Rice Vermicelli</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(If this makes you hungry, try <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/steamed-bbq-pork-buns-char-siu-bao/">this</a>)</em></p>
<p>After spending some time back at uni and doing another internship in
<strong>Frankfurt</strong>, I spent a semester abroad at Tulane University in <strong>New Orleans</strong>
in the US. I had a great time there, exploring the American South and its unique culture. If you have not been there - go see yourself. There is no place like NOLA!</p>

<p><em>Don’t forget to try the <strong>beignets</strong>!</em></p>
<p>After returning to Germany and graduating from university, I spent the last year
as a <em>gap year</em>. I did several internships in <strong>Berlin</strong> and <strong>Hamburg</strong> and
traveled through Portugal and Italy (<em>since I wasn’t able go to Asia as originally
planned… - hopefully another time!</em>)</p>
